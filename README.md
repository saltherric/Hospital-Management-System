# 🏥 Hospital Management System 

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Hospital Management System (HMS)** built using **Dart**.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and a **Layered Architecture** consisting of **Domain**, **Data**, and **UI** layers.

The main goal of this project is to design and implement a real-world problem using **good software engineering practices**, focusing on **clarity, modularity, and code reusability**.

## 🎯 Selected Feature: Managing Staff
This project focuses on **managing hospital staff**, including:
- 👩‍⚕️ Doctors  
- 👨‍⚕️ Nurses  
- 🧑‍💼 Administrative Personnel  

### ✳️ Key Operations:
- Add new staff members  
- View all staff information  
- Search staff by ID or department  
- Remove staff from the system  

This feature demonstrates OOP principles through **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation** while keeping the implementation simple and focused.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview
The project follows a **3-Layered Architecture** for clean separation of concerns:
```
lib/
├── domain/ → Core business logic (classes & models)
├── data/ → Handles data storage & CRUD operations
└── ui/ → User interface (console-based menu)

test/ → Unit tests for domain layer
```

### 🔹 Layer Descriptions

| Layer       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Domain**  | Defines core classes like `Staff`, `Doctor`, `Nurse`, and `AdminStaff`. |
| **Data**    | Provides in-memory data management (add, remove, search, list). |
| **UI**      | Offers a console-based menu for interaction. |
| **Test**    | Contains automated tests for domain logic using `package:test/test.dart`. |

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools
- **Language:** Dart  
- **Architecture:** Layered (Domain, Data, UI)  
- **Testing Framework:** `package:test/test.dart`  
- **Optional:** File persistence (JSON or text files)
